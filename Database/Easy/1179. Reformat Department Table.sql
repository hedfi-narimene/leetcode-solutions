CREATE TABLE Department (id int, revenue int, month varchar(5))
/*
In SQL,(id, month) is the primary key of this table.
The table has information about the revenue of each department per month.
The month has values in ["Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec"].
*/




-- ================================
-- Sample Input
-- ================================


insert into Department (id, revenue, month) values ('1', '8000', 'Jan')
insert into Department (id, revenue, month) values ('2', '9000', 'Jan')
insert into Department (id, revenue, month) values ('3', '10000', 'Feb')
insert into Department (id, revenue, month) values ('1', '7000', 'Feb')
insert into Department (id, revenue, month) values ('1', '6000', 'Mar')


-- ================================
--  Problem
-- ================================


/*
Reformat the table such that there is a department id column and a revenue column for each month.

Return the result table in any order.
*/


-- ================================
-- Solution
-- ================================


SELECT
    id,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'Jan' THEN revenue END) AS Jan_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'Feb' THEN revenue END) AS Feb_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'Mar' THEN revenue END) AS Mar_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'Apr' THEN revenue END) AS Apr_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'May' THEN revenue END) AS May_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'Jun' THEN revenue END) AS Jun_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'Jul' THEN revenue END) AS Jul_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'Aug' THEN revenue END) AS Aug_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'Sep' THEN revenue END) AS Sep_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'Oct' THEN revenue END) AS Oct_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'Nov' THEN revenue END) AS Nov_Revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN month = 'Dec' THEN revenue END) AS Dec_Revenue
FROM Department
GROUP BY id;

-- Explanation

/*
The revenue from Apr to Dec is null.
Note that the result table has 13 columns (1 for the department id + 12 for the months).
