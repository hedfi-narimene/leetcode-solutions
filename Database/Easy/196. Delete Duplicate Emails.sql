-- Tables Structure
-- ================================


CREATE TABLE Person (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(100)
);
/*
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.
*/


-- ================================
-- Sample Input
-- ================================


INSERT INTO Person (id, email) VALUES
('1', 'john@example.com'),
('2', 'bob@example.com'),
('3', 'john@example.com');


-- ================================
--  Problem
-- ================================


/*
Write a solution to delete all duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id.
For SQL users, please note that you are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one.
For Pandas users, please note that you are supposed to modify Person in place.
After running your script, the answer shown is the Person table. 
The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the Person table. 
The final order of the Person table does not matter.
*/


-- ================================
-- Solution
-- ================================


DELETE p
FROM Person p
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT MIN(id) AS keep_id
    FROM Person
    GROUP BY email
) AS t ON p.id = t.keep_id
WHERE t.keep_id IS NULL;


-- ================================
-- Explanation
-- ================================


/*
john@example.com is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest Id = 1.
